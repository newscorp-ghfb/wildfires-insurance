  subhed: Scoop Embeds

  The {.embed} template allows us to place embedded interactives from Scoop into our freebird projects. To use, pass the Scoop ID to the 'media' prop.

  As a Wrapper-based template, it supports all standard <a target="_blank" href="../shared/Wrapper/">Wrapper props</a> for metadata, width and margins.
